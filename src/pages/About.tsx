            Hello! My name is Carolina, a passionate web developer with a specialization in creating high-performance and aesthetically pleasing web applications. I have primarily worked in start-ups, notably on projects with Nuxt, and more recently at Retinov, a start-up specializing in health.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before diving into web development, I worked as a statistics engineer in the public sector, which allowed me to develop an analytical and rigorous approach to problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I'm a big fan of video games, reading, and manga (yes, it's a bit clich√©, but that's me!). Always curious and open to new opportunities, feel free to reach out for a chat or collaboration!
